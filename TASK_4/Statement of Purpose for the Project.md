I have chosen all my preferences as projects from Robotics Club because I find all of them very interesting and there are a lot of things I am eager to learn like ros, deep learning CAD etc.

I have chosen the project Autonomous navigation of Mars Rover as My first prefernce. This is because this project focuses on design and simulation of system for autonomous navigation of Mars Rover which uses concept like obstacle detection, Computer Vision, Deep Learning  and ROS which are my area of interests. I have interest in design too. That's why I am motivated to become a mentee in this project. 
I am quite interested in the field of robotics thats why I want to do this project in summers.
